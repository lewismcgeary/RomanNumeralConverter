# RomanNumeralConverter
An Android app which converts numbers between integers and Roman Numerals

This is an Android Studio project, created using the current latest stable version (2.3.3).

The app accepts text input and will convert integers to Roman Numerals and vice versa. The range of allowable numbers is 
1-3999 in either direction.

The project includes unit tests on the conversion logic as well as Espresso UI tests verifying that results are correctly displayed.

In Android Studio, unit tests can be run by right-clicking on the src/test/java folder and selecting Run Tests.

To run Espresso UI tests, connect a physical device or emulator, right-click on src/androidTest/java and select Run All Tests.
